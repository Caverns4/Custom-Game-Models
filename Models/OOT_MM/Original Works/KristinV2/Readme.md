Kristin Oliveres is an original character, property of Ikey Ilex/Caverns4.
... He's a boy, by the way. Everybody gets that confused.

If you are using the Randomizer, use KristinV2_OOTA_PlayAs.zobj and KristinV2_OOTY_PlayAs.zobj. These will hide the shield on the back, with is intended.
This model should be randomizer-safe.

Conversely, If you want to play him as intended:
Remove Jump Speed Limit => On
Link Speed => Max
Both voices => "Muted"
Ocarina Sound => "Flute"
Kokiri Tunic Color -> 32,32,48
You'll want to also patch Kristin_SpeedSettings.ppf on the decompressed OOT ROM to get the proper movement settings.

You may use this character freely, but please do not reverse engineer/modify this model.
If you wish to distrubute this model, please contact me at Ikey Ilex#0954 on Discord.
