# Custom-Game-Models
Custom objects I make for various games.
Unless otherwise noted in an individual folder, all models posted here and the depicted here are Copyrighted to Ikey Ilex/Caverns4.

Universally, you MAY:
	- Use a model in it's unmodified form in the game the mod is made for.
	- Distribute the unmodified model on a non-profit basis, provided you link to this Repository, or provide clear credit to Ikey Ilex and any additional credits if provided.
You may NOT:
	- Modify or alter the files from this repository and distribute modifications made.
	- Use these models on ANY for-profit basis.

This all shouldn't be an issue as these models are provided ready to be inserted into the games, and the source models are not provided.
